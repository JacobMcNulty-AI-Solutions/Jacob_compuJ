# API Versioning Strategy

## Overview

This API uses a URI-based versioning strategy to ensure backward compatibility while allowing for future evolution of the API. This document outlines the versioning rules, support policy, and migration guidance.

## Current Version

The current API version is `v1`, accessible at the base path: `/api/v1`.

All API responses include a `X-API-Version` header with the value `v1` to indicate the version that processed the request.

## Versioning Rules

### Breaking Changes

Breaking changes require a new API version (e.g., `/api/v2`). Examples of breaking changes include:

- Removing endpoints
- Removing fields from responses
- Changing field data types
- Adding required fields to requests
- Changing authentication mechanisms
- Modifying the fundamental behavior of an endpoint

### Non-Breaking Changes

The following changes may be made without incrementing the API version:

- Adding new endpoints
- Adding optional fields to requests
- Adding new fields to responses
- Bug fixes that maintain the existing contract
- Performance improvements
- Documentation updates

## Deprecation Policy

When an endpoint, parameter, or feature is scheduled for removal:

1. It will be marked as deprecated in the OpenAPI documentation
2. Responses will include a `Warning` header indicating the deprecation
3. Deprecated features will be supported for at least 6 months before removal
4. Email notifications will be sent to API users about deprecations

Example deprecation warning header:
```
Warning: 299 - "The 'sort_by' parameter is deprecated and will be removed in v3 (June 2023). Use 'order_by' instead."
```

## Version Support Lifecycle

- Each API version is supported for a minimum of 18 months after the release of its successor
- When a version is scheduled for end-of-life, users will be notified via email at least 6 months in advance
- Security patches will be applied to all supported versions

## Migration Guides

When a new version is released, a migration guide will be published that includes:

- What changes were made and why
- How to update client code to use the new version
- Examples showing before/after code
- Automated migration tools when possible

## Testing Multiple Versions

For development and testing purposes, you can specify a specific API version in your requests using either:

1. The URI path (e.g., `/api/v1/files` or `/api/v2/files`)
2. An `Accept-Version` header (e.g., `Accept-Version: v1`)

## Version Compatibility Matrix

| Feature | v1 | v2 (Future) |
|---------|-------|-------|
| File Upload | ✅ | ✅ |
| File Retrieval | ✅ | ✅ |
| File Deletion | ✅ | ✅ |
| File Updating | ❌ | ✅ (Planned) |
| Batch Operations | ❌ | ✅ (Planned) |

## Reporting Version Issues

If you encounter compatibility issues between API versions, please report them to api-support@example.com or open an issue in the GitHub repository.
